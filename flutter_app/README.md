# Gelye Sherane Cafe

The Flutter web app is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://cafe.gelyesheranecompany.com/).
Push changes to `main` to build, test, and deploy it through GitHub Actions.

To enable the first deployment, set **Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source** to **GitHub Actions** in the repository.

## Cafe website preview

The app includes a responsive cafe landing page, menu highlights, an 11-area
management showcase, and a reservation form preview. Reservations are not sent
or stored, and the staff portal is not connected to authentication or management
services.

## Local development

Run `flutter pub get`, then `flutter run -d chrome`. Use `flutter analyze` and
`flutter test` to validate changes.
